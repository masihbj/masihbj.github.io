  title={Effect of Ce Addition on the Tribological Behavior of ZK60 Mg-Alloy},
  author={Banijamali, SM and Palizdar, Y and Najafi, S and Sheikhani, A and Soltan Ali Nezhad, M and Valizadeh Moghaddam, P and Torkamani, H},
  abstract={The present work aims to study the tribological behavior of an extruded ZK60 alloy in the presence of Ce; in a previous study, among ZK60 alloys with different Ce addition rates, an alloy with 3 wt% of Ce was found to exhibit the most promising mechanical (e.g., hardness and strengths) properties, while its wear behavior remained unknown. The results of microstructural examinations by optical and electron microscopes show that Ce addition reduces the grain size from 6.1 to 2.0 μm. Besides, in addition to the precipitates already distributed in the base alloy ({Mg$_7$}{Zn$_3$}), Ce could promote the formation of a new precipitate ({MgZn$_2$}Ce), increasing the total fraction of the precipitates. These microstructural evolutions enhance the strengths of the studied ZK60 alloy, as the yield and tensile strengths increase from 212 to 308 MPa and from 297 to 354 MPa, respectively. A pin on disc tribometer was employed to study the wear behavior of the developed alloy under different normal loads (5, 20, 40, and 60 N). The results show that the base and Ce-added alloys exhibit almost a similar frictional behavior, while the wear resistance of the Ce-added alloy is higher within the load ranges applied: (i) in low load conditions (5 and 20 N), where the abrasive wear is the active mechanism, the precipitates in the Ce-added alloy could enhance the wear resistance. (ii) Under the load of 40 N, oxidative wear is also an operative wear mechanism, leading to a sharp increase in the wear rate of the alloys. In this condition, Ce could provide a protective oxide layer, which could improve the wear resistance of the alloy. (iii) At a load of 60 N, both studied alloys exhibit a similar wear rate due to a severe oxidation condition. Therefore, beyond this loading condition, the microstructural evolutions (e.g., change in precipitation behavior) caused by Ce addition can no longer contribute to the enhancement of wear resistance.},

  title={Free Vibration Analysis of Rotating Functionally Graded Conical Shells Reinforced by Anisogrid Lattice Structure},
  author={Banijamali, Seyed Masih and Jafari, Ali Asghar},
  abstract={This paper investigates the free vibration behavior of a rotating functionally graded conical shell, reinforced by an anisogrid lattice structure. The material properties of the shell are assumed to be graded in the thickness direction. The governing equations have been derived based on classical shell theory and considering the effects of centrifugal and Coriolis accelerations as well as initial hoop tension due to shell rotation. The smeared method is also employed to superimpose the stiffness contribution of the stiffeners with those of the shell to obtain the whole structure's equivalent stiffness parameters. The resulting equations, which are the coupled set of three variable coefficient partial differential equations in terms of displacement components, are solved by the Galerkin method for different boundary conditions. The obtained frequencies are compared with the available literature and the finite element software results. Finally, new results are discussed to show the effect of various parameters such as shell geometrical and material properties, stiffeners, rotating speed, and boundary conditions on natural frequencies.},

  title={The Effect of Y Addition on the Microstructure and Work Hardening Behavior of Mg-Zn-Zr Alloys},
  author={Najafi, S and Palizdar, Y and Sheikhani, A and Soltan Ali Nezhad, M and Abdiyan, F and Banijamali, SM and Torkamani, H},
  abstract={The effect of adding different amounts of Y on the microstructure, mechanical properties, texture and work hardening behavior of the extruded Mg-6Zn-0.5Zr-xY alloys (x = 0, 1, 2, 3 wt.%) was investigated. According to the results, the microstructure of all alloys is composed of α-Mg grains and {Mg$_7$}{Zn$_3$} particles. By adding Y, in addition to grain refinement, {Mg$_24$}{Y$_5$} and Mg3Y2Zn3 particles are formed in the microstructure. Among the alloys studied, the ZK60-3Y alloy has the highest strengths, as the yield stress and ultimate tensile strength of 318 and 366 MPa, respectively, were obtained for that alloy. This is due to the finer grains and higher volume fraction of the particles in the ZK60-3Y alloy. Meanwhile, reducing the grain size by Y addition affects the work hardening behavior; Y addition reduces the saturation stress, hardening capacity, and work hardening exponent by increasing the dynamic recovery; i.e., the more Y is added, the greater is the drop in the work hardening parameters. The effects of Y addition on work hardening behavior and dynamic recovery were investigated by examining microstructural developments, the volume fraction of particles and texture evaluation. The results of the texture evaluations showed that the addition of Y changes the texture component and intensity of the basal planes and can cause work hardening loss by activating slip on the non-basal planes.},

  author={Banijamali, SM and Najafi, S and Sheikhani, A and Palizdar, Y},
  abstract={This study aims to develop a novel hot-rolled WE43-B4Cp composite with improved tribological performance for employment in the automotive industry. The pin-on-disc tribometer was used to evaluate the dry tribological behavior of newly developed composite materials containing (0-10) wt.% B4C under various applied loads. It was observed that increasing B4C content reduced the friction coefficient and significantly improved wear resistance in composite samples, especially at higher applied loads. With the addition of 10 wt% B4C, the wear resistance of WE43 alloy was improved by around 25% at low load and 50% at high load regimes. The surface morphology and topography of the wear tracks were examined to identify the dominant wear mechanisms in each wear condition and reinforcement content. The dominant wear mechanisms at low loads were abrasion and slight oxidation, which were switched to adhesion and delamination as the applied load increased and thus to severe plastic deformation under high loads. The superior wear performance of the hot-rolled WE43-10%B4Cp composite was ascribed to improved hardness and strength, as well as increased work hardening capacity of subsurface due to the presence of hard and thermally stable B4C particles with uniform dispersion and proper bonding to the matrix.},

  title={Vibration Analysis and Critical Speeds of a Rotating Functionally Graded Conical Shell Stiffened with Anisogrid Lattice Structure based on FSDT},
  author={Banijamali, Seyed Masih and Jafari, Ali Asghar},
  abstract={The present study explores the frequency characteristics and critical speeds of rotating functionally graded truncated conical shells stiffened by anisogrid lattice structures. The shell and stiffener structures are transformed into an equivalent conical shell with variable stiffness and density using the smeared method. A dynamic model of the rotating equivalent structure is developed based on the first-order shear deformation theory in order to account for the effects of shear deformation and rotational inertia. By taking centrifugal and Coriolis accelerations and initial hoop tension into account, the motion equations with variable coefficients are derived using Hamilton’s principle and then are solved numerically using the generalized differential quadrature method. The obtained results under different conditions are validated by comparing them with existing data in the literature, and reliable precision is observed. A comprehensive parametric study is conducted on the frequencies of backward and forward travelling waves, with a special focus on critical speeds of the proposed conical structure.},
