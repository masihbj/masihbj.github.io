  title={Dry Tribological Behavior of Hot-Rolled WE43 Magnesium Matrix Composites Reinforced by B4C Particles},
  author={Banijamali, SM and Najafi, S and Sheikhani, A and Palizdar, Y},
  abstract={This study aims to develop a novel hot-rolled WE43-B4Cp composite with improved tribological performance for employment in the automotive industry. The pin-on-disc tribometer was used to evaluate the dry tribological behavior of newly developed composite materials containing (0-10) wt.% B4C under various applied loads. It was observed that increasing B4C content reduced the friction coefficient and significantly improved wear resistance in composite samples, especially at higher applied loads. With the addition of 10 wt% B4C, the wear resistance of WE43 alloy was improved by around 25% at low load and 50% at high load regimes. The surface morphology and topography of the wear tracks were examined to identify the dominant wear mechanisms in each wear condition and reinforcement content. The dominant wear mechanisms at low loads were abrasion and slight oxidation, which were switched to adhesion and delamination as the applied load increased and thus to severe plastic deformation under high loads. The superior wear performance of the hot-rolled WE43-10%B4Cp composite was ascribed to improved hardness and strength, as well as increased work hardening capacity of subsurface due to the presence of hard and thermally stable B4C particles with uniform dispersion and proper bonding to the matrix.},

  title={Vibration Analysis and Critical Speeds of a Rotating Functionally Graded Conical Shell Stiffened with Anisogrid Lattice Structure based on FSDT},
  author={Banijamali, Seyed Masih and Jafari, Ali Asghar},
  abstract={The present study explores the frequency characteristics and critical speeds of rotating functionally graded truncated conical shells stiffened by anisogrid lattice structures. The shell and stiffener structures are transformed into an equivalent conical shell with variable stiffness and density using the smeared method. A dynamic model of the rotating equivalent structure is developed based on the first-order shear deformation theory in order to account for the effects of shear deformation and rotational inertia. By taking centrifugal and Coriolis accelerations and initial hoop tension into account, the motion equations with variable coefficients are derived using Hamiltonâ€™s principle and then are solved numerically using the generalized differential quadrature method. The obtained results under different conditions are validated by comparing them with existing data in the literature, and reliable precision is observed. A comprehensive parametric study is conducted on the frequencies of backward and forward travelling waves, with a special focus on critical speeds of the proposed conical structure.},
