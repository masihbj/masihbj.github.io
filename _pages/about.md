Hello! I'm Masih, a graduate researcher motivated by learning new things with a passion for `Solid Mechanics` and `Materials Science`. I am currently a research assistant and a member of *Light Metals Research Group (LMRG)* at [Materials and Energy Research Center (MERC)](https://en.merc.ac.ir/), supervised by [Dr. Yahya Palizdar](https://en.merc.ac.ir/people/faculty-members/709-yahya-palizdar). I do research on Mechanical and Tribological Performance of Lightweight Alloys and Composites. I am interested in interdisciplinary research projects at the border between Mechanical Engineering, Material Science and Physics, and cultivating a collaborative and knowledge-sharing environment. My journey is driven by the goal of pursuing a PhD in the field and wish to be known as a Tribologist.

Before joining *LMRG*, I obtained my Master’s in Mechanical Engineering from [K. N. Toosi University of Technology](https://en.kntu.ac.ir/) where I work with [Prof. Ali Asghar Jafari](https://wp.kntu.ac.ir/ajafari) on Vibration Analysis of Structures. I got my Bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering from Islamic Azad University, Research and Science Branch. I also have industrial experience as an intern and part-time Mechanical Engineer at [MAPNA Locomotive Engineering and Manufacturing Co. (MLC)](https://www.mapnalocomotive.com/?lang=en).

Outside of work, I engage in some hobbies to maintain a balanced lifestyle. Regular workouts at the gym, an interest in photography and logo designing, along with a fondness for Music and TV Shows, are among my favorite leisure activities.
