Hello! I'm Masih, a graduate researcher motivated by learning new things with a passion for **Solid Mechanics** and **Materials Science**. I am currently a research assistant and a member of *Light Metals Research Group (LMRG)* at [Materials and Energy Research Center (MERC)](https://en.merc.ac.ir/). I do research on Microstructure and Wear of Light Metal Alloys and Composites.<br />
I am interested in interdisciplinary research projects at the border between Mechanical Engineering, Materials Science and Physics, and cultivating a collaborative and knowledge-sharing environment. My journey is driven by the goal of pursuing a PhD in the field and wish to be known as a Tribologist.
