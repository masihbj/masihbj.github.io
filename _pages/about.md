Hi! I'm a graduate researcher with a passion for **Solid Mechanics** and **Materials Science**, motivated by a desire to learn new things. Currently, I serve as a research assistant and a member of *Advanced Alloys Group (AAG)* at [Materials and Energy Research Center (MERC)](https://en.merc.ac.ir/), advised by Dr. Yahya Palizdar. I am broadly interested in interdisciplinary research projects at the intersection of Mechanical Engineering, Material Science and Physics, with a particular focus on the microstructure and wear of lightweight alloys and composites. My journey is driven by the goal of pursuing a PhD in Tribology and establish myself as a leading expert in this field.<br />
Previously, I received my Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from K. N. Toosi University of Technology, where I served as a research assistant and conducted extensive studies on Vibration Analysis of Shell Structures under the supervision of Professor [Ali Asghar Jafari](https://wp.kntu.ac.ir/ajafari/). Prior to that, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Islamic Azad University, Research and Science Branch. I also did summer internships at MAPNA Locomotive Engineering and Manufacturing Co. (MLC), working on vibration/stress analysis with FEM.
