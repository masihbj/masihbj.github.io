Hi there, I’m Masih, a driven researcher with a keen interest in cutting-edge research at the intersection of Mechanical Engineering, Materials Science and Physics, with a special focus on **Tribology of Lightweight Alloys and Composites**.<br>
Currently, I serve as a *Graduate Research Assistant* and member of the [AMAs Research Group](https://amasgroup.github.io/) at [Materials and Energy Research Center (MERC)](https://en.merc.ac.ir/), advised by [Dr. Yahya Palizdar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tY66SMIAAAAJ&hl=en). My research is centered on the development of novel magnesium alloys, with a focus on strategically tailoring their microstructures and optimizing mechanical properties to minimize friction and wear—extending the service life of metallic components in various engineering applications.
##### The Path So Far
I began my academic journey with a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Islamic Azad University, Research and Science Branch, where I built a solid foundation in core engineering principles. I then earned my Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering from [K. N. Toosi University of Technology](https://en.kntu.ac.ir/), where I conducted extensive research on the **Vibration Analysis of Shell Structures** as a *Research Assistant* in the Vibration and Acoustics Research Lab, under the supervision of [Prof. Ali Asghar Jafari](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9QAXzD8AAAAJ&hl=en).<br>
A pivotal moment in my career was joining the [AMAs Group](https://amasgroup.github.io/) at MERC as a *Visiting Researcher*, where I gained hands-on experience in Materials Processing, Tribotesting, and Advanced Characterization Techniques. This experience sparked my passion for Mechanics of Materials and shifted my research direction towards Materials Tribology and Light Alloys Design. This transition allowed me to merge my Mechanical Engineering background with Materials Science—a combination that drives my current research.<br>
Additionally, working as an *R&D Engineer* at [MAPNA Locomotive Co. (MLC)](https://www.mapnalocomotive.com/?lang=en) provided me with practical experience in reverse engineering, advanced materials testing, and process validation, further reinforcing my ability to apply research in industrial contexts.
##### The Road Ahead
Pursuing a PhD is the next essential step in my journey, as I seek to deepen my expertise in Tribology of Advanced Materials. My long-term goal is to contribute impactful research that advances the field and to establish myself as a leading expert in these fields.
##### Beyond Research
Outside the lab, I’m an avid coffee enthusiast and enjoy spending my time listening to music and podcasts, watching series, and strength training. I've recently found expressing my creativity through graphic design, from logo creation to website design, and trying different programming languages. Whenever I have an extended break, I love traveling, especially hiking and spending time in nature. I often step away from social noise, take a seat, and try to see, observe, rather than just looking at it. In the process, I naturally learn.
