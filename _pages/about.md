Hi there, I’m Masih, a driven researcher with a deep interest in cutting-edge research at the intersection of Mechanical Engineering, Materials Science and Physics, with a special focus on **Tribology of Lightweight Alloys and Composites**.<br>
Currently, I serve as a *Graduate Research Assistant* and a member of the [AMAs Research Group](https://amasgroup.github.io/) at [Materials and Energy Research Center (MERC)](https://en.merc.ac.ir/), advised by [Dr. Yahya Palizdar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tY66SMIAAAAJ&hl=en). My research is centered on the development of novel magnesium alloys, with a focus on strategically modifying their microstructures and improving mechanical properties to minimize friction and wear—extending the service life of mechanical systems.
##### The Path So Far
I began my academic journey with a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from [Islamic Azad University](https://srb.iau.ir/en), Research and Science Branch, where I built a solid foundation in core engineering principles. I then earned my Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering from [K. N. Toosi University of Technology](https://en.kntu.ac.ir/), where I conducted extensive research on the **Vibration Analysis of Shell Structures** as a *Research Assistant* in the Vibration and Acoustics Research Lab, under the supervision of [Prof. Ali Asghar Jafari](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9QAXzD8AAAAJ&hl=en).<br>
A pivotal moment in my career was joining the [AMAs Group](https://amasgroup.github.io/) at MERC as a *Visiting Researcher*, where I gained hands-on experience in materials processing, tribotesting, and advanced characterization techniques. This experience inspired my curiosity in Mechanics of Materials and moved my research concentration to Materials Tribology and Light Alloys Design. This transition allowed me to merge my Mechanical Engineering background with Materials Science—a combination that drives my current research.<br>
Additionally, working as an *R&D Engineer* at [MAPNA Locomotive Co. (MLC)](https://www.mapnalocomotive.com/?lang=en) provided me with practical experience in reverse engineering, advanced materials testing, and process validation, further reinforcing my ability to apply research in industrial contexts.
##### The Road Ahead
Pursuing a PhD is the next crucial step in my journey, as I strive to deepen my knowledge of Tribology of Advanced Materials. My long-term goal is to contribute impactful research that advances sustainable, energy-efficient technologies and fosters innovative solutions, ultimately working towards the betterment of <s>humanity</s> the world.
##### Beyond Research
Outside of work, I’m a coffee enthusiast who enjoys podcasts, music, photography, and watching a good TV series. Staying active at the gym or outdoors helps me maintain both physical and mental well-being. Lately, I’ve found a creative outlet in graphic design—whether designing logos or crafting website layouts. Whenever life allows for a longer pause, I love traveling, especially hiking and immersing myself in nature. I often step away from social noise, sit back, and truly reflect on my surroundings. In doing so, I naturally learn and grow.
