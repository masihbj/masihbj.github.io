During my time as an R&D Engineer at MLC, I had the opportunity to work with an experienced team of engineers on the reverse engineering of the MP610 diesel engine. Although my involvement was limited to just over a year, I contributed to a number of stages of the project, which later culminated in the successful unveiling of the first domestically developed locomotive engine in Iran.

The "MP610" diesel engine is the first domestically developed locomotive engine by expert Iranian engineers at MAPNA Industrial Group. This engine was intended to power the first domestically manufactured MAP30 mainline diesel locomotive. On Monday, May 13, 2024, the prototype MP610 diesel engine has been presented to the MAPNA Groupâ€™s plant in Alborz Province. Here's a link to further information about this event.

**Project Overview** <br>
The project to reverse-engineer and develop the MP610 diesel engine followed a detailed, multi-phase execution plan designed by the planning and engineering departments, progressing toward mass production. The key phases included:
