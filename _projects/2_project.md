During my time as an R&D Engineer at *MLC*, I had the privilege of working with an experienced team of engineers on the reverse engineering of the MP610 diesel engine. My involvement, though limited to just over a year, allowed me to contribute to some phases of the project and gain valuable insights and experience. This collaborative effort ultimately led to the successful development and unveiling of the first domestically engineered locomotive engine in Iran.<br>

The **MP610 diesel engine**, designed and developed by expert engineers at the MAPNA Industrial Group, represents a significant milestone in Iran's industrial capabilities. This engine was engineered to power the country's previously manufactured MAP30 mainline diesel locomotive. On Monday, May 13, 2024, the prototype MP610 was officially presented at the MAPNA Groupâ€™s manufacturing plant in Alborz Province. <br>

### Key Project Contributions
I contributed specifically to phases 3 through 6, where my role involved the following:<br>

- **Data Collection & Reverse Engineering:** Performed in-depth component analysis, including measurements, material composition testing, and CAD modeling to develop precise technical specifications of engine parts.
- **Technical Specifications Development & Process Planning:** Assisted in compiling test data and defining critical material properties, tolerances, and process requirements, ensuring compliance with engineering standards.
- **Procurement & Supply Chain Management:** Helped in identifying suppliers and evaluating material compatibility, focusing on cost, quality, and production timelines for key components.
- **Component Examination & Functional Testing:** Supported inspections and functional testing of prototype components, validating material integrity, mechanical properties, and overall performance to ensure reliability.

### Achievements and Impact
This project provided me with valuable experience in reverse engineering, advanced material testing, and process validation. Additionally, my engagement in supplier management and component testing broadened my understanding of complex engineering workflows and considerably expanded my research skills on a bigger scale, enabling me to tackle technical challenges with greater depth and insight.
