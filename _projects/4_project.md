My deep dive into magnesium alloys kicked off with the ZK60+REE project—an exciting introduction to materials science that really got me hooked. That early success gave me the confidence (and curiosity) to take on bigger challenges. It also led to a new chapter in my academic journey: becoming a **Graduate Research Assistant** with the *AMAs Research Group*. That role opened up opportunities to explore even more advanced materials and experimental techniques.

### The Research Focus:
Building on that momentum, I began working on a bold new project: developing a magnesium matrix composite aimed at improving performance in lightweight engineering applications. The core material? WE43 magnesium alloy, strengthened with different amounts of boron carbide (B₄C) particles. Unlike previous projects where I mostly studied existing alloys, this one asked me to take the wheel for the full ride—from designing and casting the composite to processing, testing, and analyzing it. It was a big leap, but also a great learning experience.

#### My Role:
My responsibilities spanned the entire development process. I worked on fine-tuning the stir casting technique, figuring out the best heat treatment conditions, and overcoming the complexities of hot rolling magnesium-based composites. On the analysis side, I led extensive testing—everything from optical microscopy and SEM-EDS to XRD and FTIR spectroscopy, plus mechanical tests for hardness, tensile strength, and wear behavior. The goal was to really understand how the B₄C additions and processing steps were affecting the material’s structure and performance.

It was a hands-on, problem-solving experience that pushed me to grow—not just technically, but also in terms of managing the project, staying organized, and working closely with others in the lab.

### Outcomes and Publications:
The results were impressive. Adding B₄C particles and applying hot rolling led to major grain refinement in the WE43 matrix, which in turn boosted its performance. We also uncovered some fascinating details in the microstructure. In the hot-rolled matrix alloy without much reinforcement, *twinning* turned out to be the main deformation mechanism. But when we added more B₄C particles, the behavior shifted—*dynamic recrystallization (DRX)* took over, playing a key role in refining the structure. 
Another cool microstructural feature was the uniform, *bimodal distribution* of the B₄C particles in the matrix. This happened thanks to fragmentation of the coarse reinforcements during the rolling process, resulting in a well-dispersed mix of particle sizes. That kind of distribution is especially useful for balancing strength and ductility—always a great combo in structural materials.

On the performance side, we saw increases of around 70% in hardness and 73% in strength with composites containing up to 10 wt% B₄C. Wear resistance also improved notably across all loading conditions, backed by both wear rate measurements and detailed worn surface analysis.

Interestingly, the impact of reinforcement on friction was load-dependent. Under low to moderate loads, friction either decreased or remained fairly steady even as wear rate dropped. But under high loads, friction actually increased—likely due to thermal softening or more intense plastic deformation at the contact surface. It was a good reminder that even tough materials can behave differently depending on the conditions they’re exposed to.

We published two journal articles based on this work {% cite banijamali2022WE43 %}, {% cite banijamali2022wear %}, contributing new insights to the field of lightweight composite materials.

This project wasn’t just about results—it was about growth. I sharpened my experimental and analytical skills, learned to manage complex workflows, and gained a deeper understanding of how advanced composites work. Most of all, it reminded me how exciting it is to take an idea from concept to real-world impact.
