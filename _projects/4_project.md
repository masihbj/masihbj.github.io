My journey into the fascinating world of magnesium alloys began with the ZK60 project, a groundbreaking research opportunity that sparked my passion for materials science. This early success not only deepened my appreciation for these lightweight yet versatile metals but also paved the way for new challenges. Eventually, my dedication earned me a promotion to Graduate Research Assistant in the AMAs Research Group--a milestone that opened doors into an even more exciting journey.

### The Research Focus:
Next up, I took on the ambitious task of developing a novel magnesium matrix composite--a material that promised to revolutionize lightweight engineering applications. The project centered around the WE43 magnesium alloy, reinforced with varying amounts of boron carbide (B4C) particles. Unlike my earlier research, which focused on the characterization of existing alloys, this project demanded a more holistic approach. I was responsible for overseeing the entire development cycle, from the initial stages of alloy casting and subsequent processing steps like heat treatment and hot rolling, to extensive characterization and testing of the final specimen. This broader scope presented a steep learning curve, requiring me to delve deep into the intricacies of composite materials and develop new experimental skills along the way.

#### My Role:
My role encompassed a wide range of responsibilities. I oversaw the meticulous preparation of composite materials, from optimizing the stir casting process to carefully controlling the heat treatment parameters and navigating the challenges of hot rolling magnesium-based composites. At the same time, I led rigorous experimental characterization efforts, employing advanced techniques like optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, alongside mechanical tests for hardness, tensile strength, and wear performance. I meticulously analyzed the data, unraveling the intricate relationship between processing parameters, microstructural evolution, and the resulting mechanical and tribological properties.

Through hands-on experimentation and careful planning, I not only honed my technical expertise but also strengthened my project management and leadership skills. It was a demanding yet rewarding process, combining both individual effort and teamwork to drive meaningful results.

### Outcomes and Publications:
Our findings were truly remarkable. We observed a significant grain refinement in the matrix with increasing B4C content and through the application of hot rolling. This microstructural evolution translated into substantial improvements in mechanical properties, with hardness and strength values increasing by approximately 70% and 73%, respectively, for composites containing up to 10 wt% B4C. The wear resistance of the composites also saw a significant boost, accompanied by a reduction in friction under high load conditions.

This work culminated in the publication of two high-impact journal articles {% cite banijamali2022WE43 %}, {% cite banijamali2022wear %}, cementing my contribution to the field of materials science. 

Beyond publications, the experience deepened my technical and experimental skillset, equipping me for future challenges and inspiring further exploration in advanced composite materials.
