My journey into the world of magnesium alloys began with the ZK60 project, where I was fortunate to contribute to a successful research endeavor. The experience ignited a passion for materials research and deepened my understanding of these lightweight yet incredibly versatile metals. This enthusiasm, coupled with my dedication, led to my promotion to Graduate Research Assistant within the AMAs Research Group, opening doors to new and exciting challenges.

My next venture involved the development of a novel magnesium matrix composite – a material that promised to revolutionize lightweight engineering applications. Unlike my previous work, which focused on the characterization of existing alloys, this project demanded a holistic approach. I was tasked with overseeing the entire development cycle, from the initial stages of alloy casting and subsequent processing steps like heat treatment and hot rolling, to the rigorous characterization and testing of the final product. This broader scope presented a steep learning curve, requiring me to delve deeper into the intricacies of composite material science and develop new experimental skills.

The project centered around the WE43 magnesium alloy, reinforced with varying concentrations of boron carbide (B4C) particles. My role encompassed a wide range of responsibilities. I oversaw the meticulous preparation of composite materials, from optimizing the stir casting process to carefully controlling the heat treatment parameters and navigating the challenges of hot rolling magnesium-based composites.

Concurrent with material development, I spearheaded the experimental characterization efforts. This involved employing a diverse array of techniques, including optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and a suite of mechanical tests (hardness, tensile, and wear). I meticulously analyzed the data, unraveling the intricate relationship between processing parameters, microstructural evolution, and the resulting mechanical and tribological properties.   

Our findings were truly remarkable. We observed a significant grain refinement in the matrix with increasing B4C content and through the application of hot rolling. This microstructural evolution translated into substantial improvements in mechanical properties, with hardness and strength values increasing by approximately 70% and 73%, respectively, for composites containing up to 10 wt% B4C. Furthermore, the addition of B4C particles dramatically enhanced the wear resistance of the composites while simultaneously reducing the friction coefficient, particularly under high applied loads.

This research journey was an invaluable learning experience. It not only solidified my foundation in experimental design and advanced characterization techniques but also honed my project management and leadership skills. The successful completion of this project culminated in the publication of two high-impact journal articles, further solidifying my contributions to the field of materials science.
