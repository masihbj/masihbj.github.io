This project is dedicated to ***Maryam Ahmadi-Nouri***, a talented student from our AMAs Research Group, who recently completed her thesis defense. It was my pleasure to serve as her mentor throughout this research journey.

In this study, we successfully developed extruded GZ31 magnesium alloys, both with and without silver (Ag) additions, and examined their microstructural evolution and tribological performance under varying load conditions. Miss Ahmadi's research has provided valuable insights into the behavior of these alloys, with ongoing work to further explore remaining challenges.

Following her thesis defense, further investigations are ongoing to build on these findings. Tensile testing has already been completed to finalize the mechanical properties of the alloys, which will contribute to future publications in prestigious journals. Additionally, the high-temperature tribological performance of these alloys remains under active investigation.

Since the results of this project are currently under peer review for publication, this page will be updated soon as the articles are accepted and published.
