As an **R&D Engineer** at *MLC*, I contributed to the design and construction of an industrial welding positioner specifically for railway bogie pins. The primary goal of this project was to improve the precision and efficiency of welding operations by developing a mechanical tilt-rotate positioner capable of handling heavy-duty fabrication tasks.

<h1>The Importance of Welding Positioners</h1><br>
Welding positioners play a crucial role in any fabrication shop, providing precision, improving weld quality, and significantly reducing time and costs by minimizing part handling and material waste. At MLC, our workshops already utilized hydraulic positioners for handling extra-heavy items. However, there was a need for a mechanical solution for the more precise welding of bogie pins. This project focused on developing a specialized positioner to boost efficiency, save costs, and alleviate workloads on existing hydraulic systems.

**Key Project Contributions**<br>
In this project, I was involved from the initial concept through to the final mechanical design. I worked on designing the tilt-rotate positioner, which allowed for two-axis movement, enabling welders to precisely position workpieces for optimal welding angles. My responsibilities included conducting structural analysis to ensure the frame could support heavy loads, calculating torque requirements to select suitable motors and components, and designing the rotational and tilt mechanisms for smooth and controlled movements. I also developed a clamping system to securely hold workpieces and integrated a control system for precision and safety, incorporating features such as overload protection and emergency stop systems.

**Achievements and Impact**<br>
The successful completion of this project resulted in the development of a highly efficient welding positioner tailored to the specific needs of railway bogie pins. This custom-built system has contributed to increased production speed, reduced costs, and improved the overall precision of the welding process. As a result, the project had a lasting positive impact on the workshopâ€™s productivity and overall fabrication capabilities.
