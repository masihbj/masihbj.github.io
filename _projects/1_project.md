As an R&D Engineer at *MLC*, I contributed to the design and construction of an industrial welding positioner specifically for railway bogie pins. The primary goal of this project was to improve the precision and efficiency of welding operations by developing a mechanical tilt-rotate positioner capable of handling heavy-duty fabrication tasks.


**The Importance of Welding Positioners** <br>
Welding positioners play a crucial role in any fabrication shop, providing precision, improving weld quality, and significantly reducing time and costs by minimizing part handling and material waste. At MLC, our workshops already utilized hydraulic positioners for handling extra-heavy items. However, there was a need for a mechanical solution for the more precise welding of bogie pins. This project focused on developing a specialized positioner to boost efficiency, save costs, and alleviate workloads on existing hydraulic systems.


**Key Project Contributions** <br>
Throughout this project, I was involved from the initial concept to the final mechanical design of the welding positioner. The design featured a tilt-rotate mechanism, enabling two-axis movement for optimal positioning of workpieces during precision welding. My contributions included developing an initial model, performing structural analysis to ensure stability, and calculating torque requirements to guide the selection of motors and other critical components. Additionally, I collaborated with a team to develop a secure clamping system and integrated a control system with safety features such as overload protection and emergency stop systems. Following the completion of the design and technical calculations, I also assisted in preparing the Bill of Materials (BOM), detailing all components required for constructing the positioner.


**Achievements and Impact** <br>
The successful completion of this project resulted in the development of a highly efficient welding positioner tailored to the specific needs of railway bogie pins. This custom-built system has contributed to increased production speed, reduced costs, and improved the overall precision of the welding process. As a result, the project had a lasting positive impact on the workshopâ€™s productivity and overall fabrication capabilities.
