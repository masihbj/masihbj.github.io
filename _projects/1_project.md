As an R&D Engineer at *MLC*, I contributed to the design and construction of an industrial welding positioner specifically for railway bogie pins. The goal of the project was to enhance the precision and efficiency of welding operations by introducing a mechanical tilt-rotate positioner tailored to handle heavy-duty fabrication tasks.

**The Importance of Welding Positioners**
Welding positioners are essential in any fabrication shop, providing precision, improving weld quality, and significantly reducing time and costs by minimizing part handling and material waste. Our workshop at MLC already benefited from hydraulic positioners for extra-heavy parts, but there was a need for a mechanical solution to handle the more precise welding of bogie pins. This project focused on developing a dedicated positioner to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and alleviate workloads on the existing hydraulic systems.

**Key Project Contributions**
In this project, I was involved from the initial concept through to the final mechanical design. I worked on designing the tilt-rotate positioner, which allowed for two-axis movement, enabling welders to precisely position workpieces for optimal welding angles. My responsibilities included conducting structural analysis to ensure the frame could support heavy loads, calculating torque requirements to select suitable motors and components, and designing the rotational and tilt mechanisms for smooth and controlled movements. I also developed a clamping system to securely hold workpieces and integrated a control system for precision and safety, incorporating features such as overload protection and emergency stop systems.

**Achievements and Impact**
The successful completion of this project resulted in the development of a highly efficient welding positioner tailored to the specific needs of railway bogie pins. This custom-built system has contributed to increased production speed, reduced costs, and improved precision, making our fabrication shop more agile and capable of handling complex welding tasks. As a result, the project had a lasting impact on the workshopâ€™s productivity and overall fabrication capabilities.
